# FINAL REPORT DUE 5 JANUARY 2021

Here are the instructions for the final report (limited to a maximum of 15 pages), which is also to be written collaboratively!

It should contain the following elements:

Introduction, ending with a clear layout of the questions tackled.
Methods, model used and computational algorithm.
Results (including references to figures and/or tables). The figures and tables should be captioned properly, including color scales. Describe all the figures and or tables, but do not comment on that, leave that for the discussion for the next section.
Discussion. Did you answer the question you set out to answer? Examples of other discussion points are (not limited to): How does your model mimic reality? What are its limitations? What other questions did your study open? How could you modify the model to incorporate other elements/answer other questions? How do the results compare with reality? How do the results compare with other studies found?
Conclusions. Summarize the findings in a maximum of 250 words.
References. Cite all the documents you have used to prepare the questions and that you are discussing in the discussion.
 

Use the 5 page report you have already used for the introduction and methods. Make sure you remove the project plan and gantt chartt, and avoid all formulations indicating "we will..." or "we plan to...",  this is a final report!

As in report 1, each group member writes an account on their contribution and a reflection. This reflection should be 2 pages long and is individual.
