# FINAL REPORT DUE 5 JANUARY 2021


T-cells are a type of white blood cell that play a critical role in the immune system's response to viral infections, including HIV. The interaction between T-cells and the HIV virus is complex and can occur in several different ways.

When HIV enters the body, it primarily targets and infects CD4+ T-cells, which are a type of T-cell that help coordinate the immune response. Once inside the CD4+ T-cell, the HIV virus integrates itself into the cell's DNA and begins to replicate, eventually leading to the destruction of the CD4+ T-cell.

However, T-cells can also mount an immune response against HIV by recognizing viral proteins on the surface of infected cells and attacking them. This response is mediated by two main types of T-cells: CD8+ T-cells and helper T-cells.

CD8+ T-cells, also known as cytotoxic T-cells, directly kill infected cells by releasing toxic molecules that trigger apoptosis, or programmed cell death. These cells are important for controlling viral replication and preventing the spread of HIV to other cells.

Helper T-cells, also known as CD4+ T-cells, play a crucial role in coordinating the immune response to HIV by activating other immune cells, such as B-cells and macrophages. They can also release cytokines, which are signaling molecules that help recruit other immune cells to the site of infection.

However, HIV can also evade the immune system by mutating its surface proteins, which can make it difficult for T-cells to recognize and attack infected cells. Additionally, HIV can also infect and kill other immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, which can further impair the immune response.

Overall, the interaction between T-cells and HIV is complex and dynamic, with both the virus and the immune system constantly evolving and adapting to each other.

Here are the instructions for the final report (limited to a maximum of 15 pages), which is also to be written collaboratively!

It should contain the following elements:

Introduction, ending with a clear layout of the questions tackled.
Methods, model used and computational algorithm.
Results (including references to figures and/or tables). The figures and tables should be captioned properly, including color scales. Describe all the figures and or tables, but do not comment on that, leave that for the discussion for the next section.
Discussion. Did you answer the question you set out to answer? Examples of other discussion points are (not limited to): How does your model mimic reality? What are its limitations? What other questions did your study open? How could you modify the model to incorporate other elements/answer other questions? How do the results compare with reality? How do the results compare with other studies found?
Conclusions. Summarize the findings in a maximum of 250 words.
References. Cite all the documents you have used to prepare the questions and that you are discussing in the discussion.
 

Use the 5 page report you have already used for the introduction and methods. Make sure you remove the project plan and gantt chartt, and avoid all formulations indicating "we will..." or "we plan to...",  this is a final report!

As in report 1, each group member writes an account on their contribution and a reflection. This reflection should be 2 pages long and is individual.
